        <h2>What are Runes?</h2>
        <h2><u>runes</u></h2>
        <br />
        <p>- Runes make up what is known as the Old Norse alphabet, which is also called the futhark
            (“futhark” being the pronunciation of the first six runes in the alphabet).</p>
        <p>- Runes are thought to have originated during the 1st century CE.</p>
        <p>- Each of the early Germanic civilizations (such as Anglo-Saxons and Frisians) used
            different variations of the Old Norse.</p>
        <p>- The Scandinavian version is what is now known as Elder Futhark, consisting of 24
            letters divided into three groups called ættir.</p>

        <p>- By the 9th century, Elder Futhark had been reduced from 24 letters to 16 letters. This
            version is known as Younger Futhark, and is the version that the Vikings used.</p>
        <p>- Some known inscriptions also use the Short-Twig version of the Younger Futhark, which
            was simpler and easier to write.</p>
        <p>- Certain later versions of Younger Futhark added new letters for certain sounds such as
            the G sound.</p>
