        <h2>Who Were the Vikings?</h2>
        <h2><u>vikins</u></h2>
        <p>- The Vikings were seafaring people primarily from modern day Denmark, Norway, and Sweden (known collectively as Scandinavia), though there is evidence of Vikings hailing from other countries as well.</p>

        <p>- They are known for having been strong and vicious people who raided many towns and settlements across Europe in search of wealth.</p>
        <p>- The first written evidence of a Viking raid is from 793 AD, the target being a British monastery named Lindisfarne.</p>

        <p>- Their exploits lasted for roughly 300 years, until a series of abandoned settlements and lost battles in the 11th century signaled the end of the Viking Age.</p>
